# Burger-2-
Hello, This was a  tough Homework assignment, but I got it done finally. This homework required a MySql database that house a list of different types 
of burgers named " The Works", "The Sunrise", and "The Sunset." The challenging part of this assignment was using handlbars 
and deployment to Heroku where it is being hosted. The best part about this Homework <--- insert smile here, was naming the burgers.
I guess because it is more creative. Other than that here is the AmberKing burger app.
